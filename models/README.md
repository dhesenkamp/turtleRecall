# Models

Scripts for creating the compiled models. Not all have been used in the scope of the project. Those not used can easily be imported into the `turtleRecall.ipynb` notebook and are ready for use. Parameters such as optimizer, loss function, and metrics to be tracked have to be changed on a per-model basis (inside of `model.compile()`). See docstrings or project documentation for further details on the models.
