Dennis Hesenkamp, Lennart Zastrow, Madhuri Ramesh

This repository contains all files associated with our final project for the abovementioned course. Idea and data come from Zindi's [Turtle Recall Conversation Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/turtle-recall-conservation-challenge/data).

### Virtual environment

To continue, make sure that you have a local distribution of [Conda] installed (e.g. Anaconda, miniconda, miniforge). The code in this repo has been written and tested on an Apple Silicon device with Apple's `tensorflow-macos` distribution.
