\section{Conclusion}

Due to the limitations faced within execution of our project, we can, unfortunately, only draw interim conclusions here. The AlexNet could not be tested by us, but of the EfficientNetV2-B0 and the InceptionV3, the former one appears to be the more promising model for recognising facial scales of turtles. The pre-trained EfficientNet model family has been shown to transfer well to other problems \citep{Tan2019}. This can most likely be attributed to the very effective scaling method employed by EfficientNets, which allows the model to focus more on the relevant, detail-rich regions within an image \citep{Tan2019}.
