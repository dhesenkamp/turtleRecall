# Data

This subfolder contains dataframes in form of .csv files. Also serves as directory for the images if downloaded locally. 

Three different dataframes for three different purposes:

- `train.csv`: Contains the images which are meant for initial training within the [Turtle Recall: Conservation Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/turtle-recall-conservation-challenge).
- `test.csv`: The image IDs on which testing is supposed to be done within the challenge. Image IDs are not annotated with corresponding turtle IDs. Not used in this very project.
- `extra_images.csv`: Contains additional image IDs
